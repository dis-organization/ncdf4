# ncdf4

The goal of ncdf4 is to provide an "Interface to Unidata netCDF (Version 4 or Earlier) Format Data Files". 

This fork of the CRAN package `ncdf4` is intended to update the Windows build process, and specifically to add support for Thredds. 

## Todo

* check Makevars.win (assume can remove "DHAVE_LIBUDUNITS2" but what about "-DHAVE_DECL_NC_RENAME_GRP=1"?)
* add tests, especially for Thredds (make sure 32-bit Windows limitation is understood)
* roxygenize?

## Installation

You can install the released version of ncdf4 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("ncdf4")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mdsumner/ncdf4")
```
